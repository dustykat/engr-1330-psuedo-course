## Purpose
The purpose of the repository is to maintain a convienent back-up of course content for rapid migration across servers.  

## Special Notes
The structure is written to work on a web host, with hostname == `atomickitty.ddns.net`, if you clone to another server you will have the lovely task of changing the links.  

The string editor `sed` will become your friend!
