    "- `if` statement\n",
    "- `if....else` statements\n",

    "All flow control in a program depends on evaluating conditions. The program will proceed\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon knowing what you kind of want is based on correlations of your past behavior compared to other peoples similar, butmore recent behavior, and then it uses conditional statements to decide what item to offer you in your recommendation items. \n",
    "It's spooky, but ultimately just a program running in the background trying to make your money theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common conditional operation is comparison. If we wish to compare whether two\n",
    "variables are the same we use the == (double equal sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example x == y means the program will ask whether x and y have the same value. \n",
    "If they do, the result is TRUE if not then the result is FALSE.\n",

    "There are also three logical operators when we want to build multiple compares\n",
    "(multiple conditioning); these are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `and` operator returns TRUE if (and only if) **all** conditions are TRUE.\n",
    "For instance `5 == 5 and 5 < 6` will return a TRUE because both conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `or` operator returns `TRUE` if at least one condition is true. \n",
    "If **all** conditions are FALSE, then it will return a FALSE. For instance `4 > 3 or 17 > 20 or 3 == 2` will return `TRUE`because the first condition is true.\n",
    "The `not` operator returns `TRUE` if the condition after the `not` keyword is false. Think of it\n",
